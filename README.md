PawTrack

An animal shelter receives numerous adoption requests and pet care queries via phone calls, emails, and walk-ins. Tracking available pets, their medical records, and adoption status is done manually, which often causes delays and poor record-keeping. The shelter also struggles to follow up with adopters and remind them about vaccination or vet visits for their pets.
ðŸ‘‰To address this, the shelter wants to implement a  CRM to:
â€¢	Manage pet profiles with details like breed, age, vaccination records, and adoption status.
â€¢	Automate the adoption request process, including approvals and notifications.
â€¢	Maintain adopter profiles and their adoption history.
â€¢	Schedule and send reminders for vet check-ups and vaccinations.
â€¢	Provide dashboards and reports for shelter staff on adoption trends and pet health tracking.
